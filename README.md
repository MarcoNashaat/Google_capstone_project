# Google Capstone Project - Data Analysis Final Course
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Google Capstone project completed as part of the final course of the Data Analysis Specialization. The project follows the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act. The project was conducted using Jupyter notebooks in Python.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Cyclistic bike-share company data for 2019. The data is available [Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and is provided in 4 separate files, one for each quarter.

## Notebooks
The project is divided into three separate notebooks, each corresponding to a different phase of the data analysis process: Ask-Prepare-Process, Analyze, and Share-Act.

## Ask-Prepare-Process
This notebook covers the first three phases of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, and Process. In this notebook, data is loaded from the 4 separate files and merged together into one dataset. The data is then cleaned and processed to ensure that it is ready for analysis.

## Analyze
In this notebook, the cleaned and processed data from the previous notebook is analyzed. Various data visualizations and statistical measures are used to gain insights into the data and answer the initial questions posed in the Ask phase.

## Share-Act
In this final notebook, the insights gained from the previous notebook are shared and acted upon. Recommendations are made based on the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Slide Show Presentation
In addition to the analysis conducted in the Jupyter notebooks, a slide show presentation has been provided to visually communicate the key findings of the project. The presentation includes charts and graphs created from the data visualization process in the Analyze notebook. The slides provide a summary of the insights gained from the data analysis and recommendations for Cyclistic bike-share company.

## Conclusion
The Google Capstone Project allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the Data Analysis Specialization to a real-world dataset. Through the use of Jupyter notebooks and Python, I was able to successfully complete the data analysis process and gain valuable insights into the Cyclistic bike-share company data for 2019. The slide show presentation provides an effective way to share these insights with stakeholders and decision makers at the company.
